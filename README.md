# PSK_RTTY_Tranceiver
An Arduino based Transceiver to transmit and receive (decode) RTTY and PSK project built by Dave Rajnauth, VE3OOI

The project is meant to demonstrate that its capable to decode digital signals using limited processing capabilities of a 8 bit microcontroller.  In the case of the Arduino Mega, at 16 Mhz.

The hardware fork includes the schematic and board layout for the hardware needed and the software fork includes all source code used for the project.
